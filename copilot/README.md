# Living Documentation Copilot

Our framework continuously scans your codebase, cross-checks it against the latest best practices from official documentation, changelogs, and security advisories, and surfaces actionable suggestions right where you work.

## Features

- Detects gaps such as missing docstrings, outdated configs, and security missteps
- Pulls in up-to-date guidance from curated sources
- Ranks suggestions by impact and relevance to your tech stack

## Future Vision

With an integrated NLP layer, this will evolve into an **in-IDE tooltip assistant**. As you hover over a function or class, it prompts you with context-aware documentation hints — not just “add a docstring,” but tailored, best-practice language you can accept, tweak, and commit instantly. This turns documentation and standards into a **flow-friendly, one-click habit**, improving maintainability without slowing down delivery.

**In short:** a self-updating engineering playbook, baked into your workflow — no more stale docs, no more missed conventions, just continuous, living guidance in the right place at the right time.
