# Phase 2 Development Tickets - Kilo Regex Explainer

## Priority: Critical (Launch Blockers)

### TICKET-001: Improve Regex Detection Robustness
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The current regex detection in the Zsh plugin uses a simple `grep -oE '/.*?/'` pattern which is too naive and will fail on many valid regex patterns.

**Issues:**
- Fails on regexes without delimiters (e.g., `\d+` vs `/\d+/`)
- Doesn't handle escaped slashes in patterns (e.g., `/path\/to\/file/`)
- Non-greedy match `.*?` may not capture complete patterns
- No validation that detected pattern is actually a regex

**Suggested Solution:**
- Implement more sophisticated regex detection logic
- Support both delimited (`/pattern/flags`) and non-delimited (`pattern`) formats
- Add pattern validation before processing
- Consider context clues (common regex metacharacters)

**Tools:** Zsh pattern matching, regex validation

---

### TICKET-002: Add Comprehensive Error Handling
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Current error handling is minimal and doesn't provide helpful feedback for common failure scenarios.

**Missing Error Handling:**
- Node.js not installed or wrong version
- Missing dependencies (regexp-tree)
- Invalid regex patterns with helpful suggestions
- Plugin directory resolution failures
- Clipboard access failures (silent fallback)

**Suggested Solution:**
- Add dependency checks with installation guidance
- Provide specific error messages for common regex syntax errors
- Add graceful degradation when clipboard tools unavailable
- Include troubleshooting information in error messages

**Tools:** Zsh conditionals, Node.js error handling, dependency checking

---

### TICKET-003: Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Plugin assumes specific clipboard tools and shell behaviors that may not work across all platforms.

**Platform Issues:**
- macOS: Uses `pbpaste` (good)
- Linux: Tries `xclip` and `xsel` but may not be installed
- Windows/WSL: No clipboard support
- Different Zsh versions may handle `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-${(%):-%x}}` differently

**Suggested Solution:**
- Test on macOS, Linux (multiple distros), Windows/WSL
- Add fallback clipboard detection
- Verify path resolution across different Zsh versions
- Document platform-specific requirements

**Tools:** Virtual machines, Docker containers, CI/CD testing

---

## Priority: High (User Experience)

### TICKET-004: Improve User Feedback and Guidance
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Plugin provides minimal feedback when it can't find a regex, making it hard for users to understand what went wrong.

**Improvements Needed:**
- Show what sources were checked (clipboard, history, argument)
- Provide examples of supported regex formats
- Add verbose mode for debugging
- Better success/failure indicators

**Suggested Solution:**
- Add `-v` verbose flag to show detection process
- Improve "No regex found" message with suggestions
- Add examples in help text
- Consider colored output for better visibility

**Tools:** Zsh parameter expansion, ANSI color codes

---

### TICKET-005: Add Installation and Setup Automation
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Current installation requires manual steps that could be automated for better user experience.

**Manual Steps to Automate:**
- Running `npm install` in plugin directory
- Verifying Node.js version compatibility
- Setting up plugin in Zsh configuration
- Testing installation

**Suggested Solution:**
- Create installation script (`install.sh`)
- Add setup verification command
- Provide Oh My Zsh integration instructions
- Add uninstall script

**Tools:** Shell scripting, package managers, Oh My Zsh conventions

---

### TICKET-006: Performance Optimization
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Plugin spawns Node.js process for each explanation, which may be slow for frequent use.

**Performance Concerns:**
- Node.js startup time (~100-200ms)
- Module loading overhead
- No caching of explanations
- Clipboard access on every call

**Suggested Solution:**
- Implement explanation caching based on regex pattern
- Consider keeping Node.js process alive (daemon mode)
- Optimize clipboard checking (cache recent clipboard content)
- Add performance benchmarking

**Tools:** Zsh associative arrays for caching, process management, benchmarking tools

---

## Priority: Medium (Polish & Features)

### TICKET-007: Enhanced Regex Detection Patterns
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Expand regex detection to handle more real-world scenarios where developers encounter regexes.

**Additional Sources:**
- Detect regexes in file contents (grep, sed, awk commands)
- Extract from programming language syntax (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Support for different regex flavors (PCRE, POSIX, etc.)
- Detect in configuration files

**Suggested Solution:**
- Add context-aware detection based on command history
- Support multiple regex extraction patterns
- Add language-specific regex detection
- Consider file content scanning

**Tools:** Advanced pattern matching, language parsers

---

### TICKET-008: Add Configuration Options
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Allow users to customize plugin behavior for their workflow.

**Configuration Options:**
- Default regex sources priority (clipboard vs history vs argument)
- Output format preferences (verbose vs concise)
- Caching behavior
- Clipboard tool preferences

**Suggested Solution:**
- Create configuration file (`~/.kilo-regex-config`)
- Add environment variable overrides
- Provide configuration validation
- Document all options

**Tools:** Zsh configuration parsing, environment variables

---

### TICKET-009: Add Interactive Mode
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Provide interactive mode for exploring regex patterns and testing explanations.

**Interactive Features:**
- Prompt for regex input if none detected
- Show multiple explanation formats
- Test regex against sample text
- Step-through explanation mode

**Suggested Solution:**
- Add `-i` interactive flag
- Use `read` for user input
- Integrate with existing explanation engine
- Add quit/help commands

**Tools:** Zsh `read` builtin, interactive UI patterns

---

## Priority: Low (Nice to Have)

### TICKET-010: Add Explanation Caching
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Cache explanations to improve performance for repeated patterns.

**Caching Strategy:**
- Use pattern hash as cache key
- Store in temporary directory
- Implement cache expiration
- Add cache management commands

**Tools:** Zsh associative arrays, file system caching, hash functions

---

### TICKET-011: Integration with Popular Tools
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Add integration hooks for popular development tools and workflows.

**Integration Points:**
- Vim/Neovim plugin
- VS Code extension
- Git hooks for commit message regex validation
- Shell completion for common patterns

**Tools:** Editor APIs, shell completion systems, Git hooks

---

### TICKET-012: Add Regex Testing Mode
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Allow users to test their regex patterns against sample text.

**Testing Features:**
- Provide sample text input
- Show matches with highlighting
- Test different flags
- Performance testing for complex patterns

**Tools:** Node.js regex engine, text processing, ANSI formatting
